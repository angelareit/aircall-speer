This is a front-end technical assesment for Speer.IO.

The app has the following features:
- **Activity Feed** - simple list of calls
- **Activity Detail** - detail of a call
- **Archive** - the final user should be able to archive (and unarchive) a call. Archived calls will no longer be displayed on the Activity Feed and should have a separate Archived Tab.
- A button to archive all calls in the activity feed
- A button to unarchive all calls in the archived calls tab

## API documentation

### Routes

Here is the API address: https://cerulean-marlin-wig.cyclic.app/ <br>
If you run into a CORS error, please prepend the base URL with this CORS Anywhere server URL: https://charming-bat-singlet.cyclic.app/ <br>
The prepended base URL will look like this https://charming-bat-singlet.cyclic.app/https://cerulean-marlin-wig.cyclic.app/

The API is hosted on a free server, which is why the first time you call the API, it will throw an error. The server goes to sleep if there hasn't been any activity for a while, but after 30-60 seconds of the first call, it should work as expected. Please reach out to us in case it doesn't.

- **GET** - BASE_URL/activities: get calls to display in the Activity Feed
- **GET** - BASE_URL/activities/<call_id> retrieve a specific call details
- **PATCH** - BASE_URL/activities/<call_id> update a call. The only field updatable is `is_archived (bool)`. You'll need to send a JSON in the request body:
```
{
  is_archived: true
}
```
- **PATCH** - BASE_URL/reset: Reset all calls to initial state (usefull if you archived all calls).
